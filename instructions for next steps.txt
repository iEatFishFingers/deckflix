+ videos are stored in tmp file located in the c drive 

+ the title of the video doesnt show it shows Unknown Movie - Torrent Stream (Peerflix) instead

+ you cant load the videos unless you use the mpv application 

+ the internal video doesnt work the screen shows up blank but you can hear the audio 

+ it seems that the code actually looks at this folder in the tmp located in the c drive but get the first thing in there which was rick and morty before 

+ we need to implement a feature that looks for the ID in this case the god father ID is 20edd4cd63eb1833827c8e35011fb8792e4d77d2 and it should look through the tmp/torrent-stream/20edd4cd63eb1833827c8e35011fb8792e4d77d2 then inside of that will be the vidoeo

+ look into this whole setup working on a steam deck make sure the videos will actually play on a steamdeck and the UI will fit the screen

+ look into seeing if the user is using a controller it will fully work and it will work in steamdeck controller supporting:
	-xbox
	-playstation
	-steamdeck default settings
-- FEATURES TO ADD -- 

+ similar to stremio when loaidng it should open up with the logo of the actual movie/series and have a loading bar but the loading bar is the logo
	maybe like stremio having the logo of the film in the middle but 2 versions. 1 being less opace and the other being fully visbale 
	now when loading the from left to right the fully visbale one will act as the loading bar 

+ Now the UI. at the moment ive noticed there is alot of padding around the sides i no longer want that. i want it to be 4 rows of cards that
	1st row being past watched shows 
	2nd row being the popular movies that are out
	3rd row being the popular series that are out
	4th row being the popular animes that are out

	the user should be able to scroll through each one category
